Wrangling & Analyzing WeRateDogs from Twitter Data

This folder contains the files for the project three on Wrangling & Analyzing a Twitter data of WeRateDogs.

The goal of the project: Gathering and combining multiple datasets of WeRateDogs from Twitter to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering using the Twitter API, then programmatically assessing and cleaning was required for great analyses and visualizations.

Based on the data analysis I found that better dogs are twitted recently. The question is why? Maybe more good dogs pictures are coming to Twitter or good dogs are more breeding, or the WeDogRates might be more generous these years.
